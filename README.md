# An Ensemble Hypergraph Learning framework for Recommendation

This page contains support material for the paper: A Gharahighehi, C Vens and K Pliakos, “An Ensemble Hypergraph Learning framework for Recommendation”, under review in 29th Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization (UMAP).

Four datasets are used in this study:

* AOTM [1]: You can download the dataset from this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/n281js5mgsvao6s/AADQbYxSFVPCun5DfwtsSxeda?dl=0).
* Movielens [2] You can download the dataset from this [link](https://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-2011/).
* Globo.com [3] You can download the dataset from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/gspmoreira/news-portal-user-interactions-by-globocom).
* Roularta

# Implementation

Set the dataset directory in [run.sh](https://github.com/alirezagharahi/ensemble_hypergraph/blob/main/run.sh) and then run it.
